<project_name> is a Python 3 <console program? I'm not sure what the right term to use here is.> to get Weather Forecast from AerisWeather API using the city and country codes as parameters and send a text message to your phone presenting the information in a user-friendly way by adding a quote related to the current weather in that location.

- Python 3.6 installed in your OS
- AerisWeather client_id and client_secret - You can obtain your own here: https://www.aerisweather.com/signup/developer/
You will also need to get a Twilio account to use their SMS web API to send text messages to your own phone:
- Twilio Account SID and Auth Token - You can obtain yout own here: https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio

Installation

You must update the client_is, client_secret, Twilio Account SID and Auth Token parts in the code accordingly after obtaining your own. The comments in the code will give you further directions on that.
